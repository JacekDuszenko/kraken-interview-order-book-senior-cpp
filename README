How to run the server and test client.

# Build the server
1. Build the Docker image `docker build -t krakentask .`
2. Run the container and exec into it `docker run -it krakentask /bin/bash`
3. cd into `/home` directory in the running container.
4. Run `cmake .` to generate build files.
5. Run `cmake --build .` to build the binary and tests.

# Run the server and the client inside the container
1. In a home directory in a shell inside the running container, run `./krakentask` to start the server on port 1234.
2. Open a new terminal and exec into the container to get a second shell. Firstly check the hash of a running docker image by running `docker ps`.
Then exec into the container like this`docker exec -it [CONTAINER_HASH] /bin/bash`. Go to the /home directory.
2. Run `python3.8 client.py inputFile.csv localhost 1234` to parse and send data contained in `inputFile.csv` into the server.

You should see output data being printed in the first shell.

# Run unit tests
To start unit tests, run `./unit_tests` binary that's located inside the `test` directory. From `/home` directory you can run `./test/unit_tests`.
